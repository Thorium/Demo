This is technical demo to apply F-Sharp (F#) language in real world application. 
This application is close to real world enterprise application (with very optimal solutions, at least in 2011).

The function of this application is to get Stock Quote Data and Historical Stock Prices from Yahoo Finance


Architecture visaul presentation: Architecture.pptx

There are two web user interfaces: 
1. Silverlight 5.0 MVVM made with Expression Blend
   - Silverlight F# 2.0 ViewModel and client logics dll
2. HTML 5.0 + jQuery 1.6.1 + Javascript (Ajax)

Those both uses the same underlying WCF REST JSON WebService.
The WebService has both accesspoints, JSON and SOAP, but JSON is used.

The WebService uses F# 2.0 business logics.


Client:
StocksApplicationSL - Silverlight XAML application
StocksApplicationViewModel - Silverlight F# Library

Server:
StocksApplication.Web - Website/application, contains StocksService.svc-webservice and html-client
StocksServiceLogics - F# Library

StocksApplicationVS2010 should work with VS2010 and with Blend. I made another just becaus Blend is still Beta.
